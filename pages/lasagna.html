    <h1>LASAGNA</h1>
    <img src="../img/lasagna.jpeg" alt="Immagine di Lasagna">
    <p> <strong>Lasagna</strong> originated in <em>Italy</em> during the <em>Middle Ages</em>. The oldest transcribed text about <strong>lasagne </strong> appears in 1282 in the <em>Memoriali Bolognesi</em>, 
        in which lasagne was mentioned in a poem transcribed by a Bolognese notary; <br> while the first recorded recipe was set down in the early 
        14th-century <em>Liber de Coquina</em> (The Book of Cookery). <br> It bore only a slight resemblance to the later traditional form of lasagne, 
        featuring a fermented dough flattened into thin sheets (lasagne), boiled, sprinkled with cheese and spices, and then eaten with a small pointed stick.<br>
        Recipes written in the century following the <em>Liber de Coquina</em> recommended boiling the pasta in chicken broth and dressing it with cheese and chicken fat. 
        In a recipe adapted for the Lenten fast, walnuts were recommended.
